# Console interaction

### Computing areas / circumference of circle/rectangle
>
> The program should ask "Shape: (Circle or (R)ectangle".
> If the answer is circle, it should ask for the radius of the circle the answer is rectangle,
> it should ask for side lenghts A then B of the rectangle.

> After that, the area and circumference of the specified shape should be printed. Some hints To make this interaction >
   testable, you need some way to verify the "dialog" that happens between the user and the program. Try to spell out examples >  of the interaction: Example 1 Program prints "Shape: (Circle or (R)ectangle?", and the user answers "R". Then the progreyn >  prints "Rectangle side A length?" The user answers "5" Then the program prints "Rectangle side B length?" The user answers >  "10". Then the program prints "Area=50" And then "Circumference=30" How do you translate that to automatic test code? If you > could, you would be very close to making the program-user interaction testable.
